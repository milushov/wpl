(This)[http://wpl.me] awesome backbone application on rails for backend for listening musical playlists from social network (vk.com)[http://vk.com/wikiplaylists]. Key feature is collaborative editing those thematic playlists. Each registered user can edit playlist through voting for each track. Or just add new track on playlist. I think this app - next generation of apps like stereomood.com or collectiveplaylist.com. Enjoy using :3
